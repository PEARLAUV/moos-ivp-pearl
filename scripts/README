#########################################################################
Directory for Arduino sketches to be used on front seat (currently an 
Arduino MEGA) for the PEARL platform.
#########################################################################

The current front seat architecture utilizes an NXP 9-dof IMU board and
the Madgwick filter for sensor fusion.

The following Arduino libraries are required (some of these libraries 
have other library dependencies that will be installed at the same time):
Adafruit Sensor Calibration
Adafruit AHRS
Adafruit Sensor Lab
IBusBM

#========================================================================
# PEARL_frontseat_v2
#========================================================================
Script to be used on PEARL's frontseat during operation. RC control is
implemented for manual control of motors and autonomous mission override.

NMEA sentences sent over serial port from Arduino to RPi:
$PLIMU,<manual control flag>,<yaw>,<pitch>,<roll>*
$PLRAW,<Acc X>,<Acc Y>,<Acc Z>,<Gyro X>,<Gyro Y>,<Gyro Z>,<Mag X>,<Mag Y>,<Mag Z>*
$PLMOT,<last commanded left thrust percentage>,<last commanded right thrust percentage>*

NMEA sentences sent over serial port from RPi to Arduino:
$PICOM,<desired left motor thrust percentage>,<desired right motor thrust percentage>*

#========================================================================
# PEARL_imu_calibration
#========================================================================
Script for calibrating the NXP IMU implemented on PEARL's frontseat. Requires
use of the RC controller. Refer to README_calibration for instructions on 
performing the calibration.

#========================================================================
# sensor_write_calibration
#========================================================================
Script for writing calibrations to the Arduino, which are stored in 
permanent memory on the board. Inputs within the scripts are:
-Hard iron offsets (uTesla)
-Soft iron offsets (uTesla) (don't need to change these)
-Gyro zero-rate offsets (rad/s)
-Accelerometer zero-rate offsets (m/s^2)

You can use the sketch at Examples->Adafruit Sensor Calibration->sensor_calibration_read
to view the current calibrations stored on the board.
