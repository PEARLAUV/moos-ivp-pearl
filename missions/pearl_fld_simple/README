Single vehicle mission to be used on PEARL in the field. Has the following 2 capabilities:
-A waypoint mission with a single waypoint. Used for commanding PEARL to move in a straight
 line. DEPLOY commands PEARL to move to the waypoint, and RETURN commands her back to the
 starting point.

-Manual motor thrust control. Pressing spacebar in pMarineViewer brings up a menu that allows
 you to increment the thrust on each motor up or down by 10%. Each motor can be commanded
 individually, both at the same time, or both in the opposite directions.

Launch instructions:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(shoreside terminal)
>> ./launch_shoreside.sh

**note that the proper shore/vehicle IP addresses and ports must be specified
either in the launch_shoreside.sh executable or at the command line. Type
./launch_shoreside.sh -h for a full list of possible command line arguments.

(remote vehicle terminal)
>> ./launch_vehicle.sh

**note that the proper shore/vehicle IP addresses and ports must be specified
either in the launch_vehicle.sh executable or at the command line. Type
./launch_vehicle.sh -h for a full list of possible command line arguments.

Once both MOOS communities are running, the manual control switch (SwD) on the RC
controller must be flipped ON and OFF in order to run missions and behaviors. PEARL 
starts up in manual override mode by default for safety. 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Variables/Parameters to adjust:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-Shoreside laptop and PEARL RPi IP addresses (Variable names: SHORE_IP, PEARL_IP)
	Location: launch_vehicle.sh, launch_shoreside.sh
	Note that we can specify these IP addresses as command line arguments
	when running either script, but for simplicity it makes sense to 
	just change the defaults in the code.
**The ports that MOOS-IvP uses to communicate between shore/PEARL are also set
in the launch scripts. You shouldn't need to change these, but that's where
they are just in case.

-PEARL waypoint cruise speed (CRUISESPEED)
	Location: launch_vehicle.sh
	This is the speed PEARL will set when moving between waypoints.
	Currently speed is set to 0.3 m/s.

-Station-keeping radius (inner_radius, outer_radius, hibernation_radius)
	Location: meta_vehicle.bhv
	The important thing here is inner_radius, which defines the area within
	which PEARL can drift while station-keeping. Currently inner_radius
	is set to 5 meters.

-PID controller gains
	Location: plug_pPearlPID.moos
	Currently set as: P=1, I=0, D=0

-PEARL/IMU heading offset (HEADING_OFFSET)
	Location: plug_iPEARL.moos
	PEARL's heading is calculated by adding this offset (in degrees) to
	the heading measured by the IMU.

-Sun Tracking mode ON/OFF (SUN_TRACKING)
	Location: plug_pPearlPID.moos
	true = sun tracking mode ON
	false = sun tracking mode OFF

-PEARL/solar panels offset (SUN_HEADING_OFFSET)
	Location: plug_uSunTracking.moos
	PEARL's heading during sun-tracking mode is calculated by adding this
	offset (in degrees) to the calculated solar azimuth angle.

-Max thrust/rudder percentages (MAX_THRUST, MAX_RUDDER)
	Location: plug_iChargeController.moos
	MAX_THRUST is the maximum thrust percentage that can be commanded to the
	motors. MAX_RUDDER is typically set as MAX_THRUST/2.

-Origin set point (Lat, Long)
	Location: plug_origin_warp.moos
	This is the latitude and longitude that corresponds to the point (0,0) on the 
	local grid. The local grid uses units of meters.

-Waypoint/return point locations (points)
	Location: meta_vehicle.bhv
	This are the locations of the waypoints on the local grid (so they are in 
	units of meters). Each waypoint behavior in the meta_vehicle.bhv file has
	a specified set of points.
